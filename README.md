Denial of Service establishing connections to `localhost`
=========================================================

Infrastructure to test `getaddrinfo()` on different systems when DNS servers
are timing out. Thorough analysis, project history and technical background is
in [Uber Engineering Blog](https://eng.uber.com/denial-by-dns).

Problem statement
-----------------

If a service resolves and opens connections to dependencies through DNS, a
flaky DNS of the dependency can DOS the service by preventing opening new
connections to seemingly innocent endpoints like `localhost`.

This repository provides information about which programming languages and
development environments are vulnerable.

How it works
------------

For every language/environment, a container is configured with:

* Unreachable DNS server.
* HTTP server running on `:8080` and logging to a known path.

An environment test does the following:

* Call `http://localhost:8080`. This call should always succeed; if it
  doesn't, there is an error in the test.
* Call `http://example.org` `N` times in parallel, do not wait for the result.
  `N` depends on knowledge of the environment, usually a few more than the
  default thread pool size.
* Wait 1 second to make sure all calls of the above are scheduled.
* Call `http://localhost:8080`. This call will succeed iff the application is
  not vulnerable.

Scripts checks the number of times `http://localhost:8080` is called:
* **0**: there is an error with the setup. Script should succeed at least once.
* **1**: application is vulnerable. First invocation succeeded, second failed.
* **2**: application is not vulnerable.

Contributing
------------

To add a new programming language/environment, check the `nodejs-http` example.
If you created a test for your (favorite) language/environment, please submit a
pull request here, so others can benefit from your work too.

Travis-ci is testing the examples and verifying whether the report in the pull
request is accurate. If travis-ci build fails, you probably forgot to commit
this file. :)
